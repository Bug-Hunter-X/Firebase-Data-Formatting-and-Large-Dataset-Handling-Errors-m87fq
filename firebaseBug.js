The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data is not properly formatted, such as missing a required field or using an invalid data type.  For example, if you are expecting a number but receive a string, an error can occur. Another issue is when dealing with large datasets where the SDK might not handle them efficiently, resulting in timeouts or performance issues. This can be more pronounced with offline capabilities.
