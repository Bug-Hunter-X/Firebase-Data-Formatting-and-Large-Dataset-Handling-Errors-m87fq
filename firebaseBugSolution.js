To address data formatting issues, always validate data before sending it to Firebase. Implement robust input validation and data transformation to ensure that data conforms to the expected structure and types. To handle large datasets efficiently, use pagination techniques to fetch data in smaller chunks. Consider using client-side filtering and sorting to reduce the amount of data transferred. Batch writes can help improve write performance. Employ appropriate error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage potential timeouts or performance problems.  Ensure proper indexing is implemented in your database rules.
